# Flutter OCR Scanner App 📱

A complete Flutter application for extracting, enhancing, translating, and converting text using **Google ML Kit**, **TTS**, **QR/Barcode Scanning**, **Image Cropping**, and **PDF Exporting**.  

The app provides a smooth end-to-end workflow: **capture → crop → process → recognize → translate → read aloud → export**.

The project follows a **feature-based architecture** for better organization, scalability, and maintainability.

### Architecture Benefits
✅ **Feature Isolation**: Each feature is self-contained  
✅ **Reusability**: Shared widgets and models reduce duplication  
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code  
✅ **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes debugging easier  
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different features  
✅ **Testing**: Isolated features are easier to test

## 🐞 Known Issues & Roadmap

### Current Known Issues

#### 🔊 TTS Language Switching
- **Issue**: After translating to Arabic, TTS continues playing in Arabic even when English is selected
- **Cause**: TTS engine state not properly reset between language changes
- **Workaround**: Restart the app to reset TTS state
- **Fix Status**: 🔄 In Progress

#### 📍 Geo Location Parsing
- **Issue**: `geo:` URL format in QR codes not properly supported by ML Kit
- **Cause**: ML Kit limitation + missing custom parser
- **Workaround**: Code is commented out
- **Fix Status**: 📋 Planned
